IMPORTING THE PROJECT

Software Requirements:

1. Wordpress software from https://wordpress.org/download/
2. XAMPP (recommended) or WAMP

Instructions:
1. After installing XAMPP, go to xampp/htdocs and create a folder. The folder will serve as the directory that will contain all of the wevsite files.
2. Open the wordpress software directory (e.g. wordpress-5.2.3/wordpress). Copy all the contents of the folder, and paste it under the website directory you just created in Step 1.
3. Start the Apache and MySQL modules from XAMPP. Make sure a database has already been created in phpmyadmin.
4. In your browser, go to localhost/website-name. You will now install Wordpress. Supply the necessary information.
5. After successfully installing Wordpress, head over to localhost/website-name/wp-admin. This screen is called the admin dashboard.
6. On the left side of the screen, hover over the Plugins, and select Add New.
7. Search for the plugin "All-in-One WP Migration" and install the plugin. Activate it afterwards.
8. After successfully activating the plugin, there should be another item in the side nav, named after the newly installed plugin. Hover over the item, and select Import.
9. Download the backup file in this GitHub repository under /backups, and drag-and-drop the file in the plugin.
10. Pray that it imports successfully. GLHF!
